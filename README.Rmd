`nlist` is an R package to create and manipulate numeric list (`nlist`) objects.

An `nlist` is an S3 class list of uniquely named numeric objects.
An numeric object is an integer or double vector, matrix or array.
`nlist` objects are the raw data inputs for analytic engines such as JAGS, STAN and TMB.

An `nlists` object is a S3 class list of `nlist` objects with the same names, dimensionalities and typeofs.
`nlists` objects are useful for storing multiple realizations of simulated data sets.
They can be converted to `coda::mcmc` and  `coda::mcmc.list` objects.

## Demonstration

### `numeric`

An numeric object is an integer or double vector, matrix or array.

```{r}
library(nlist)
is.numeric(1L)
is.numeric(matrix(1:3))
```

### `nlist`

An `nlist` is an S3 class list of uniquely named numeric objects.

It is straightforward to create an new `nlist` object.
```{r}
library(nlist)

nlist <- nlist(x = 1, y = matrix(1:9, 3))
nlist
```

### `nlists`

An `nlists` object is a S3 class list of `nlist` objects with the same names, dimensionalities and typeofs.

The nchains attribute is used to keep track of the number of chains.

```{r}
nlists <- nlists(
  nlist(x = 1, y = matrix(1:9, 3)),
  nlist(x = -2, y = matrix(2:10, 3)),
  nlist(x = 10, y = matrix(22:30, 3)),
  nlist(x = -100, y = matrix(-2:-10, 3))
)

print(nlists)
```

### Coercion

#### nlist

A data.frame can be coerced to an `nlist` object
```{r}
data <- data.frame(
  lgl = c(TRUE, NA),
  dte = as.Date(c("2001-01-02", "2001-01-01")),
  fac = factor(c("b", "a"))
)

as_nlist(data)
```

And an `nlist` objects can be converted to an `mcmc` or `term_frame` objects (and converted back again)
```{r}
as_mcmc(nlist)
as_term_frame(nlist)
```

#### nlists

The `estimates()` function can be used to aggregate an `nlists` object to an `nlist` object.
```{r}
estimates(nlists, fun = mean)
```

while the `tidy()` function treats the values as if they are MCMC samples
and summarises the terms as a tidy tibble.
```{r}
tidy(nlists, simplify = TRUE)
```


An `nlists` object can be converted to an `mcmc.list` object and a `term_frame`.
```{r}
as_mcmc_list(nlists)
as_term_frame(nlists)
```

An `nlists` object can have its chains split or collapsed.
```{r}
split_chains(nlists)
```
