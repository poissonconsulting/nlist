Description: Create and manipulate numeric list (nlist) objects.
    An nlist is an S3 list of uniquely named numeric atomic (natomic)
    objects.  An natomic object is an integer or double vector, matrix or
    array.  An nlists object is a S3 class list of nlist objects with the
    same names, dimensionalities and typeofs.  Numeric list objects are of
    interest because they are the raw data inputs for analytic engines
    such as 'JAGS', 'STAN' and 'TMB'.  Numeric lists objects, which are
    useful for storing multiple realizations of of simulated data sets,
    can be converted to coda::mcmc and coda::mcmc.list objects.
