Description: Create and manipulate numeric list (nlist) objects.
  An nlist is an S3 list of uniquely named numeric atomic (natomic) objects.
  An natomic object is an integer or double vector, matrix or array.
  An nlists object is a S3 class list of nlist objects with the 
  same names, dimensionalities and typeofs.
  Numeric list objects are of interest because they are the raw data inputs 
  for analytic engines such as 'JAGS', 'STAN' and 'TMB'.
  Numeric lists objects, which are useful for storing multiple realizations of
  of simulated data sets, can be converted to 
  coda::mcmc and coda::mcmc.list objects.
