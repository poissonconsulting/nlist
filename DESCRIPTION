Description: Create and manipulate numeric list ('nlist') objects.
    An 'nlist' is an S3 list of uniquely named numeric objects.  
    An numeric object is an integer or double vector, matrix or array.  
    An 'nlists' object is a S3 class list of 'nlist' objects with the
    same names, dimensionalities and typeofs.  Numeric list objects are of
    interest because they are the raw data inputs for analytic engines
    such as 'JAGS', 'STAN' and 'TMB'.  Numeric lists objects, which are
    useful for storing multiple realizations of of simulated data sets,
    can be converted to coda::mcmc and coda::mcmc.list objects.
